Certain nouns followed by the particle na or no have the force of adjectives, and are called quasi-adjectives. 
When used predicatively de takes the place of na (or no) and is followed by aru, arimasu or gozaimasu according to the degree of politeness. Note that de aru is generally abbreviated to da, and de arimasu to desu. In the negative na (or no) is changed to de wa (often abbreviated to ja). Some true adjectives may be used attributively as quasi-adjectives in na after 
supressing the final i of the adjective. Thus okii uchi or oki na uchi a big house ; chiisai mise or chiisa na mise a small shop.
