True adjectives when used as predicates in connection with the polite verb gozaru change their terminations as shown in 1).The negative construction of these sentences is shown in 2). 

1) True adjectives end in ai, ii, oi or ui. These terminations are changed according to the way in which the adjective is used, as shown in the following table : 

 attribute             | takai  | yasashii  | shiroi  | samui |
 predicate             | takai  | yasashii  | shiroi  | samui |
 predicate with gozaru | tako   | yasashiu  | shiro   | samu  |
 adverb                | takaku | yasashiku | shiroku | samuku|

2) Ordinary negative adjectives in nai are not used in combination with gozaru ; in these polite sentences the negation is to be found in the inflexion of the verb itself : 
It is not dear ; takaku nai or tako gozaimasen : never takaku no gozaimasu. However, there is no objection to using ordinary adjectives which happen to end in nai, as kitanai dirty, before the verb gozaru : kitano gozaimasu.
